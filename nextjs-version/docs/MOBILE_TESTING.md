- Large: 769px - 1024px
- Extra Large: 1025px and above

## Testing Areas

### 1. Responsive Layout

- [ ] Verify that all UI elements adjust appropriately to different screen sizes
- [ ] Check that text is readable on all devices without horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Ensure that interactive elements have appropriate touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- [ ] Verify that spacing between elements is sufficient to prevent accidental taps

### 2. Map Interaction

- [ ] Test pinch-to-zoom functionality
- [ ] Verify smooth panning/scrolling of the map
- [ ] Test province highlighting on tap/touch
- [ ] Ensure info popups are properly positioned and readable
- [ ] Verify that the legend is accessible and readable

### 3. Controls and Navigation

- [ ] Test all buttons and interactive controls for touch accuracy
- [ ] Verify that the mobile menu opens/closes correctly
- [ ] Ensure dropdown menus and selectors work properly on touch devices
- [ ] Test the language selector on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify theme toggle works correctly

### 4. Performance

- [ ] Measure initial load time on various devices
- [ ] Test scrolling performance and smoothness
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended interaction
- [ ] Verify that the application remains responsive during all interactions

### 5. Accessibility

- [ ] Test with screen readers on mobile (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android)
- [ ] Verify touch gestures work with accessibility features enabled
- [ ] Ensure sufficient color contrast on mobile displays
- [ ] Test keyboard accessibility with external keyboards

## Testing Methods

### 1. Emulator/Simulator Testing

- Use Chrome DevTools Device Mode for initial testing
- Test on iOS Simulator and Android Emulator

### 2. Real Device Testing

- Test on physical devices when possible
- Use browser developer tools to simulate different device conditions

### 3. Automated Testing

- Implement Cypress or Playwright tests for responsive behavior
- Create test scripts for common mobile interaction patterns

## Reporting Issues

When reporting mobile-specific issues, include:

- Device make and model
- Operating system version
- Browser used (if applicable)
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- Expected vs. actual behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

The application will be considered mobile-ready when:

1. All critical functionality works on the target devices
2. No horizontal scrolling is required on any screen
3. All interactive elements are easily tappable
4. Performance is acceptable on mid-range devices
5. No major visual inconsistencies exist across devices
