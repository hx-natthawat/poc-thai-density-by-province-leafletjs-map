# Thai Population Density Map - Future Improvements

This document outlines planned improvements and feature additions for the Thai Population Density Map project.

## High Priority

- [ ] **Fix Type Declarations**: Resolve the "Cannot find module 'next-themes/dist/types'" lint error by adding proper type declarations
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit**: Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit and implement improvements for WCAG compliance
- [ ] **Mobile Testing**: Test thoroughly on various mobile devices and screen sizes to ensure responsive design works properly
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Optimize map rendering and data loading for better performance on low-end devices
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling for map loading and data fetching failures

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **Additional Map Features**:
  - [ ] Add search functionality to find specific provinces
  - [ ] Implement province comparison feature
  - [ ] Add ability to filter provinces by population density ranges
  - [ ] Implement year selection for historical data comparison
- [ ] **Data Visualization Improvements**:
  - [ ] Add alternative visualization methods (bar charts, graphs)
  - [ ] Implement data export functionality (CSV, JSON)
  - [ ] Add tooltips with additional province information
- [ ] **UI Enhancements**:
  - [ ] Create a settings panel for user preferences
  - [ ] Add animation transitions between map states
  - [ ] Improve legend with more detailed information
  - [ ] Add a tutorial/onboarding experience for first-time users

## Low Priority

- [ ] **Internationalization**:
  - [ ] Add Thai language support
  - [ ] Implement language switcher
- [ ] **Social Features**:
  - [ ] Add ability to share specific map views
  - [ ] Implement screenshot/image export functionality
- [ ] **Advanced Features**:
  - [ ] Add 3D visualization option for population density
  - [ ] Implement time-based animations for data changes
  - [ ] Add correlation with other demographic data

## Technical Debt

- [ ] **Code Refactoring**:
  - [ ] Extract common map functionality into reusable hooks
  - [ ] Improve state management architecture
  - [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] **Documentation**:
  - [ ] Create detailed component documentation
  - [ ] Document API and data structures
  - [ ] Add inline code comments for complex logic

## Infrastructure

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - [ ] Set up automated testing
  - [ ] Implement deployment workflow
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring
